## Background

I gave ChatGTP the following prompt:

> could you write a minimal MINST implementation in Rust?

It came back with the below (edited for markdown, but the edit would not meet
the minimal degree of creativity to make it a copyrightable work):

> Sure! Here's a minimal implementation of a simple MINST virtual machine in Rust:

> This implementation includes the `pushSelf`, `pushConst`, `add`, `sub`, `mul`, and `div` operations, along with a simple `run` method that interprets the bytecode program and executes the instructions. The `main` function demonstrates how to use the virtual machine to compute a simple expression.
